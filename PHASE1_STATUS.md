**Commit:** `6f31e12` - "Remove CocoaPods infrastructure (Podfile, Podfile.lock, .xcworkspace)"

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Manual - Requires Xcode)

The following steps **require Xcode** and cannot be automated via CLI:

### Step 1: Open Project in Xcode
```bash
cd /Users/ryanschefske/Developer/Reading
open Reader.xcodeproj  # Note: .xcodeproj NOT .xcworkspace (which was deleted)
```

### Step 2: Clean CocoaPods Build Phases

**In Xcode:**
1. Select **Reader** project in navigator (blue icon)
2. Select **Reader** target
3. Click **Build Phases** tab
4. Look for and **DELETE** these three phases:
   - `[CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock`
   - `[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks`
   - `[CP] Copy Pods Resources`
5. Also check **Build Settings** tab:
   - Search for "Framework Search Paths"
   - Remove any paths containing "Pods" or "$(PODS_ROOT)"

**After cleanup:**
- Clean Build Folder: **Product → Clean Build Folder** (⌘⇧K)
- The project won't build yet (missing dependencies) - that's expected!

### Step 3: Add SPM Dependencies

**File → Add Package Dependencies...**

#### Add in this order:

**1. Firebase iOS SDK**
```
URL: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
Version: 11.5.0 (or "Up to Next Major Version")

Select these products:
✓ FirebaseCore
✓ FirebaseAnalytics
✓ FirebaseCrashlytics  (NEW - for crash reporting)
```

**2. Google Mobile Ads SDK**
```
URL: https://github.com/googleads/swift-package-manager-google-mobile-ads
Version: 11.0.0 (or latest 11.x)

Select this product:
✓ GoogleMobileAds
```

**3. WeScan**
```
URL: https://github.com/WeTransfer/WeScan
Version: 2.0.0 (or latest 2.x - check releases)

Select this product:
✓ WeScan
```

**Notes:**
- SPM resolution may take 5-10 minutes (Firebase is large)
- If resolution fails, try: **File → Packages → Reset Package Caches**
- Don't add MarqueeLabel - it's not used in the code

**After adding packages:**
```bash
# Commit the SPM lock file
git add Reader.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved
git add Reader.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
git commit -m "Add SPM dependencies: Firebase 11.x, GoogleMobileAds 11.x, WeScan 2.x"
```

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks (Can be automated after SPM added)

Once SPM dependencies are added, these tasks can be scripted:

### 4. Create New Files

**Need to create:**

1. **Reader/Managers/AdManager.swift**
   - Centralizes AdMob integration
   - Replaces UIView extension pattern
   - Full code in PHASE1_SPM_MIGRATION.md (search "NEW FILE: Managers/AdManager.swift")

2. **Reader/Utilities/AppError.swift**
   - Error handling enum
   - Localized error messages
   - Full code in PHASE1_SPM_MIGRATION.md (search "enum AppError")

### 5. Update Existing Files

**Files requiring import/code changes:**

1. **AppDelegate.swift** - Update Firebase imports and initialization
2. **InputTextController.swift** - Replace Firebase ML Vision with Apple Vision framework
3. **7 ViewControllers** - Update to use AdManager:
   - SpeechRecognizerViewController.swift
   - SpeechViewController.swift
   - SpeedReadViewController.swift
   - ReadViewController.swift
   - ReadingChoicesViewController.swift
   - ScanViewController.swift (may not need changes)
   - InputTextController.swift (AdMob changes)

4. **DELETE: Extensions/UIView+Ads.swift** - No longer needed (replaced by AdManager)

### 6. Update Xcode Project Settings

**Build Settings to modify:**
- iOS Deployment Target: 13.0 → 15.0
- Swift Language Version: Swift 5 → Swift 5.10
- Enable: Strict Concurrency Checking
- Disable: Bitcode (deprecated by Apple)

### 7. Test Build

- Clean build folder
- Build project (⌘B)
- Fix any compilation errors
- Run on simulator
- Test all features

## 🎯 Quick Resume Instructions

**To continue this migration:**

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ryanschefske/Developer/Reading
   open Reader.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Follow "Next Steps" above** starting with cleaning build phases

3. **After SPM is added,** let me know and I can:
   - Create the AdManager and AppError files
   - Update all ViewControllers
   - Migrate Firebase ML Vision to Apple Vision
   - Update project settings
   - Help test the build

4. **Or continue manually** using the comprehensive guide in:
   - `PHASE1_SPM_MIGRATION.md` (full detailed guide)

## 📝 Important Notes

### Why Xcode is Required

Swift Package Manager integration is managed by Xcode's GUI in these areas:
- Package dependency resolution
- Product selection (which frameworks to link)
- Build phase integration
- Code signing updates
- Framework linking

These cannot be reliably done via command line without risk of project corruption.

### What's Been Automated

Everything that can be safely automated via CLI has been done:
- ✅ Git branch management
- ✅ File deletion (CocoaPods)
- ✅ .gitignore updates
- ✅ Documentation creation
- ✅ Dependency audit

### What Requires Xcode

The following must be done in Xcode GUI:
- 🔧 Adding SPM packages
- 🔧 Removing CocoaPods build phases
- 🔧 Updating build settings
- 🔧 Testing and building

### What Can Resume Automated After Xcode Steps

Once SPM is added, these can be automated:
- 📝 Creating new Swift files (AdManager, AppError)
- 📝 Updating import statements
- 📝 Migrating Firebase ML Vision → Apple Vision
- 📝 Refactoring AdMob usage

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Project won't open
```bash
cd /Users/ryanschefske/Developer/Reading
git checkout master  # Go back to working state
git branch -D feature/modernization-phase1-spm  # Delete branch
# Start over from beginning
```

### Want to start fresh
```bash
# Reset to last commit
git reset --hard HEAD

# Or go back to pre-migration
git checkout master
```

### Need help
